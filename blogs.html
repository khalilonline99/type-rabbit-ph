        <h3 class="question">What is the difference between local and sessions storage?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Local Storage:</span> The data stored in localStorage persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available for all current and future visits to the site. It is used for use for long term use.
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Session Storage:</span> Changes are only available per tab. Changes made are saved and available for the current page in that tab until it is closed. Once it is closed, the stored data is deleted. It is used use when you need to store somthing that changes or somthing temporary

        <h3 class="question">What is the difference between global and block scope?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Global Scope:</span> It can be accessed beyond any block. Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope. (var, let and const) They all have global scope
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Block Scope:</span> It is only accessed within a block. ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const. These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript. Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block

        <h3 class="question">How javascript event loop works</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Event Loop:</span> JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks.The Event Loop has one simple job and that is to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.
